To do list using HTML, CSS, JS

A to-do list is a common application used to manage tasks or items that need to be completed. It allows users to add, remove, and mark items as done.
To create a to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, follow these steps:

1)HTML Structure:
      Start by creating the basic HTML structure for the to-do list. The list will consist of an input field to add tasks, a button to add tasks, and 
      an area to display the list of tasks.

2)CSS Styling:
      Create a CSS file (styles.css) to style the to-do list. You can customize the appearance according to your preferences.

3)JavaScript Functionality:
      Create a JavaScript file (script.js) to add interactivity to the to-do list. This script will handle adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed,
      and removing tasks.
